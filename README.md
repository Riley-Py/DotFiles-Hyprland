# DotFiles

Hello everyone, and welcome to my dotfiles.  This repository holds all of my personal dotfiles that are used for my Hyprland
setup! The main theme of this setup is using the tool PyWal as much as possible to make everything match to the wallpaper. 
This allows for an ambient setup and not having to worry about color matching so much.  Below are some screenshots:

## Notes

- This is constantly shifting and evolving as we speak - I will be adding to this as I add more stuff to my system
- It may disappear sometimes - GitHub was erroring out on me when I try to make this public and then try to commit stuff. This repository therefore may go private for a bit, and then go public again
- I love Hyprland very much - customization is far _superior_ to GNOME and window managers allow for great workflows.  As well, since Hyprland uses config files, I can basically move this system to another computer in a matter of _minutes_.
