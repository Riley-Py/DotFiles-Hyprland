# DotFiles

Hello everyone, and welcome to my dotfiles/first rice.  This repository holds all of my personal dotfiles that are used for my Hyprland
setup! The main theme of this setup is using the tool PyWal as much as possible to make everything match to the wallpaper. 
This allows for an ambient setup and not having to worry about color matching so much.  Below are some screenshots:

## Note
- This is constantly shifting and evolving as we speak - I will be adding to this as I add more stuff to my system


## Closing Remarks
I love Hyprland very much; streamlined, customizable, and the best part: _clean_.  Also, I finally learned how to use gitignore so that I don't have to manually add files (yay!!)
